      <description>There are many applications which require a fast edge detection algorithm. For example, real time object detection algorithms apply edge detection on the visual data fed to them in order to simplify the object detection.
Despite being developed in 1986, the Canny edge detection algorithm is still at the forefront of edge detection methods. This is because it offers a very good trade-off between accuracy and speed.
Definition of an edge An edge is a curve in the image of roughly even intensity, such that in crossing the curve there is an abrupt change in intensity.</description>
