Fourier is a simple Python2 demo library which implements a number of image processing algorithms in C++. 

The performance of the library is not a priority, instead, the main aim of the library is to offer implementations which are approachable and enhance understanding of the algorithms. To this end, all algorithms run single threaded on a CPU, rather than being offloaded to a GPU.
